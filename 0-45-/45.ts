//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

import { features } from "process";

 function storeCarinfo(manufacturer: string, modelName: string,...extraOptions: {[key:string]:any}[]):
Object {  

const carinfo={    
    manufacturer,
    modelName,
    ...Object.assign({...extraOptions},)
    

}
return carinfo;
}
 let answer=storeCarinfo('HONDA','CIVIC',{color:'black'},{features:['navigation','power window']})
 console.log(answer);
